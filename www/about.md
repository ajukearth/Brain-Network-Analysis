# About Brain Network Analysis App

## Overview

The Brain Network Analysis App is a comprehensive tool for neuroscientists and researchers to analyze functional connectivity networks in the brain. This application provides a streamlined workflow to import, process, analyze, and visualize brain network data.

## Features

### Comprehensive Analysis Workflow

The application follows a structured 7-step workflow:

1. **Data Import**: Upload your data from various file formats
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis
3. **Correlation Methods**: Generate connectivity matrices using various correlation approaches
4. **Network Analysis**: Calculate graph theory metrics to characterize networks
5. **Visualization**: Interactive visualization of networks and results
6. **Advanced Analysis**: Apply sophisticated analysis techniques for deeper insights
7. **Results**: Export and share your findings

### Powerful Network Analysis

- **Multiple Correlation Methods**: Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Partial Correlation, and more
- **Graph Theory Metrics**: Density, Clustering, Path Length, Modularity, and various Centrality measures
- **Community Detection**: Identify functional modules within brain networks
- **Network Comparison**: Compare networks across different groups or conditions

### Advanced Analysis Techniques

- **Multi-method Consensus**: Combine results from different correlation methods
- **Network Stability**: Assess the robustness of network metrics through bootstrapping
- **Information Theory**: Analyze mutual information and entropy in brain networks
- **Brain-Behavior Prediction**: Predict behavioral outcomes from network properties

### Interactive Visualization

- **Network Graphs**: Interactive 2D and 3D network visualizations
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualize connectivity patterns with hierarchical clustering
- **Metric Plots**: Visual summaries of network metrics across groups and regions
- **Custom Layouts**: Multiple layout algorithms for optimal network visualization

## Development

This application was developed using R and Shiny, with the following key packages:

- **Shiny & shinydashboard**: Web application framework
- **igraph**: Network analysis and visualization
- **ggplot2 & plotly**: Data visualization
- **dplyr & tidyr**: Data manipulation
- **RColorBrewer**: Color palettes for visualization
