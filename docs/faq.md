# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Enhanced Brain Network Analysis app?
The Enhanced Brain Network Analysis app is a comprehensive Shiny application designed for neuroscientists and researchers working with brain connectivity data. It provides a streamlined workflow for importing, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing brain network data with an emphasis on correlation-based functional connectivity networks.

### Who is this app designed for?
This app is primarily designed for neuroscientists, neuroimaging researchers, and anyone working with brain connectivity data. It's particularly useful for researchers who want to analyze functional connectivity networks without extensive programming knowledge.

### What are the system requirements?
- R version 4.0.0 or higher (4.2.0+ recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for larger datasets)
- Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Is this app free to use?
Yes, the Enhanced Brain Network Analysis app is open-source software released under the MIT License. You can use, modify, and distribute it freely.

## Data Questions

### What data formats can I use with this app?
The app supports CSV (.csv) and Excel (.xlsx, .xls) file formats. Your data should be structured with subjects as rows and brain regions as columns, with additional columns for subject IDs and grouping variables.

### What should my data look like?
Your data should include:
- A subject/ID column that uniquely identifies each subject
- At least one grouping variable (e.g., condition, treatment, diagnosis)
- Multiple numeric columns representing measurements from different brain regions
- Optional behavioral measures for correlation analyses

Example format:
```
Subject,Group,Sex,Region1,Region2,Region3,Behavior1
1,Control,Male,3.5,4.2,2.8,25.3
2,Treatment,Female,3.8,4.5,3.0,28.7
...
```

### How many brain regions and subjects can I analyze?
The app can handle datasets with up to several hundred brain regions and subjects. However, performance may decrease with very large datasets (e.g., voxel-level data with thousands of regions). For optimal performance, we recommend using parcellated data with 50-300 regions.

### Can I use this for structural connectivity data?
While the app is primarily designed for functional connectivity analysis, you can use it with structural connectivity data as well. The correlation methods may be less relevant for structural data that already represents connection strengths, but the network analysis and visualization components will work with any connectivity matrix.

## Analysis Questions

### What correlation methods are available?
The app supports multiple correlation methods:
- Pearson correlation (parametric, sensitive to linear relationships)
- Spearman correlation (non-parametric, sensitive to monotonic relationships)
- Kendall's tau (non-parametric, robust to outliers)
- Partial correlation (controls for the influence of other variables)

### How are networks constructed from correlation matrices?
Networks are constructed by:
1. Computing pairwise correlations between all brain regions
2. Applying a threshold to remove weak connections (optional)
3. Converting the thresholded correlation matrix to a graph structure
4. Calculating network metrics on the resulting graph

### What network metrics are calculated?
The app calculates numerous network metrics, including:

**Global metrics:**
- Network density
- Global clustering coefficient
- Characteristic path length
- Small-world index
- Modularity
- Global efficiency

**Node-level metrics:**
- Degree centrality
- Betweenness centrality
- Closeness centrality
- Eigenvector centrality
- Participation coefficient
- Within-module z-score

### How does the multi-method consensus analysis work?
The multi-method consensus analysis:
1. Calculates connectivity matrices using multiple correlation methods
2. Normalizes these matrices to make them comparable
3. Applies a consensus approach (e.g., rank aggregation, weighted averaging)
4. Identifies connections that are consistently strong across methods
5. Generates a consensus network representing the most reliable connections

This approach helps mitigate the biases of individual correlation methods and produces more robust network results.

## Troubleshooting

### The app crashes when I try to load my data
This could be due to:
- Data formatting issues (check your CSV/Excel file for inconsistencies)
- Memory limitations (try reducing the size of your dataset)
- Missing required columns (ensure you have ID and group columns)

Try examining your data structure carefully and ensure it meets the requirements described in the User Guide.

### I get an error about missing packages
Run the following command in R to install all required packages:
```R
source("setup.R")
```
Alternatively, install the missing package manually with `install.packages("package_name")`.

### Network visualization is very slow
For large networks with many nodes:
- Reduce the number of edges by increasing the correlation threshold
- Use simpler layouts (e.g., "circle" instead of "force-directed")
- Consider applying community detection and visualizing at the community level

### Missing values in my data cause problems
The app provides several options for handling missing data:
- Mean/median imputation for simple cases
- KNN or MICE imputation for more complex patterns
- Option to exclude regions or subjects with excessive missing data

Refer to the Preprocessing section of the User Guide for detailed instructions.

### The app warns about low variance regions
Regions with very low variance (near-constant values) provide little information for correlation analysis and can cause computational issues. Consider:
- Examining these regions for data quality issues
- Excluding these regions from analysis
- Transforming your data to increase variance
